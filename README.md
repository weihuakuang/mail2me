# Mail2Me

Mail2Me is a lightweight email feedback system built with Next.js. Users can submit their name, email, and message via a web form, and the system automatically sends this information to a specified administrator email address using an SMTP service.

## ✨ Features

- **User Feedback Form**: A clean form containing fields for name, email, and message.
- **Email Integration**: Sends emails using Nodemailer via SMTP (configured for QQ Mail by default).
- **Real-time Feedback**: The UI provides real-time status updates (Sending, Success, or Failure) after submission.
- **Responsive Design**: Built with Tailwind CSS to ensure compatibility across various screen sizes.
- **Type Safety**: Fully written in TypeScript.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Framework**: [Next.js 14](https://nextjs.org/) (App Router)
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Email Service**: Nodemailer
- **Backend API**: Next.js API Routes

## 🚀 Quick Start

Follow these steps to run the project locally:

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd mail2me
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` or `.env.local` file in the root directory and add the following environment variables:

```env
# Email account for sending emails (Recommended: QQ Mail, SMTP service must be enabled)
EMAIL_USER=your_email@qq.com

# Email Authorization Code (This is NOT your email password, it's the auth code generated by the SMTP service)
EMAIL_PASS=your_email_auth_code
```

> **Note**: 
> 1. The code currently hardcodes the SMTP server to `smtp.qq.com` (QQ Mail). If you use a different email service, please modify the `transporter` configuration in `src/app/api/send-email/route.ts`.
> 2. The recipient email is currently hardcoded as `wkuang.ia@qq.com`. You can change the `to` field in `src/app/api/send-email/route.ts`.

### 4. Run the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the result.
